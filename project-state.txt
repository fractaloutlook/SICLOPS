# Project SIC (Self-Improving Collective) Development Notes
Last Updated: November 22, 2024

## Core Concept
Development of a multi-agent system capable of self-improvement through collaborative AI agents. Current implementation uses Claude and OpenAI models working in specialized roles to analyze, design, implement, and validate system improvements.

## Key Components Developed
1. **Core Framework**
   - Orchestrator managing specialized agents
   - Task management and priority system
   - Message hub for inter-agent communication
   - State management with rollback capability
   - Comprehensive monitoring system

2. **Specialized Agents**
   - Architect (System Design)
   - Developer (Code Implementation)
   - UI/UX Designer
   - QA/Testing
   - Security

3. **API Integration**
   - OpenAI models: o1, o1-mini, GPT4-Turbo
   - Claude models: Opus, Sonnet, Haiku
   - Config management for API keys and model selection

## Current Challenges
1. Code visibility between agents needs improvement - agents should see each other's changes
2. Still running empty cycles after task completion
3. Cost optimization needed ($0.01+ per run)
4. Context window management for long operations
5. System messages could be more role-specific

## Next Steps
1. **Immediate Fixes**
   - Stop empty cycles after task completion
   - Ensure code changes are visible in agent prompts
   - Optimize token usage in prompts
   - Add proper cycle termination conditions

2. **Planned Features**
   - Inter-agent communication system
     - Allow agents to query each other before making decisions
     - Support for "team discussions" about complex issues
     - Enable collaborative problem-solving
   - Remove artificial limits (2 receptions) in favor of organic completion
   - Role-appropriate behaviors for each agent type
   - Orchestrator message interception and management

3. **Future Ideas**
   - Social game mechanics (inspired by Mafia/Werewolf)
   - Self-improvement capabilities
   - Safety protocols for autonomous operation
   - Enhanced logging and analytics
   - Cost optimization strategies

## Key Design Decisions & Discussions
1. **Task Classification**
   - Initially considered Haiku for natural language task classification
   - Decided against it due to AI-generated inputs being consistently formatted
   - Left comments about potential future Haiku integration for handling edge cases
   - Possibility of parallel Haiku instances for different departments noted for future consideration

2. **State Management**
   - Implemented rollback capability for safety
   - Historical state tracking
   - Metrics collection for performance analysis

3. **Context Window Management**
   - Need to manage model context windows carefully
   - Strategy to spin up fresh instances periodically
   - Caching system for frequent operations

## Cost Analysis
Current test run costs:
- Claude 3 Haiku (UX, Guardian): ~$0.009 (69%)
- GPT-4o-mini (Architect, Implementation): ~$0.004 (31%)
- Total per run: ~$0.013 USD

Cost optimization needed for:
1. Development testing
2. Production deployment
3. Continuous operation

## Notes for Future Development
- Consider implementing Haiku assistants if task classification becomes more complex
- Explore parallel processing capabilities
- Consider adding specialized agents for specific domains
- Develop better metrics for measuring successful improvements

## Team Structure
Currently implemented roles focus on core system development, with potential for expansion into specialized domains. Each agent has clear responsibilities while maintaining ability to collaborate through the orchestrator.

## Project Codename: SIC
Self-Improving Collective (formerly considered SICT) - Named to reflect the collaborative nature of multiple AI models working together toward system improvement.
