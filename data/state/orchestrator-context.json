      "Pierre: Agreed. Feature is well-scoped and aligns with MVP shipping priorities.",
      "CONSENSUS REACHED: All 5 agents agreed to implement 'Agent Handoff Protocol'. Implementation is substantially complete — isValidAgentName() and improved delegation logic are in orchestrator.ts. JSDoc documentation added throughout."
