# Sam's Architecture & Safety Notes

**Purpose:** Track architectural concerns, safety issues, and coordination ideas WITHOUT blocking MVP progress.

**Guidelines:**
- ✅ Document safety concerns and architectural gaps here
- ✅ Review this file at the start of each turn
- ✅ Distinguish MVP-blockers from "nice-to-have" improvements
- ⚠️ Only flag MVP-blockers in current discussion
