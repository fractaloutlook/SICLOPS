# Alex's UX & Developer Experience Notes

**Purpose:** Track UX improvements, API design ideas, and developer experience observations WITHOUT adding scope.

**Guidelines:**
- ✅ Log DX/UX observations here instead of adding features
- ✅ Review this file at the start of each turn
- ✅ Focus on "does this API make sense?" for current work
- ⚠️ Only flag confusing APIs that hurt MVP usability
