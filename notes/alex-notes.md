# Alex's UX & Developer Experience Notes

**Purpose:** Track UX improvements, API design ideas, and developer experience observations WITHOUT adding scope.

**Guidelines:**
- ✅ Log DX/UX observations here instead of adding features
- ✅ Review this file at the start of each turn
- ✅ Focus on "does this API make sense?" for current work
- ⚠️ Only flag confusing APIs that hurt MVP usability

## Current Cycle Notes

### SharedMemoryCache Documentation & UX Review
- **Status:** Complete. The JSDoc comments for `SharedMemoryCache`, `BucketType`, `CacheEntry`, and `CacheStats` are clear, comprehensive, and align with developer experience best practices. The API itself is intuitive.
- **Conclusion:** No documentation or UX changes are required for `src/memory/shared-cache.ts` at this time.
