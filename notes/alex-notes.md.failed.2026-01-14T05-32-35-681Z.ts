# Alex's UX & Developer Experience Notes

**Purpose:** Track UX improvements, API design ideas, and developer experience observations WITHOUT adding scope.

**Guidelines:**
- ✅ Log DX/UX observations here instead of adding features
- ✅ Review this file at the start of each turn
- ✅ Focus on "does this API make sense?" for current work
- ⚠️ Only flag confusing APIs that hurt MVP usability

## Current Cycle Notes

**Validation Pipeline Documentation (Pending Implementation)**
- Waiting for Morgan to implement code-validator.ts and typescript-validator.ts
- Once implemented, will add:
  - JSDoc comments to all validation functions
  - Update docs/SYSTEM_CAPABILITIES.md with validation workflow section
  - Create usage examples showing how agents trigger validation
  - Document validation error formats for agents
