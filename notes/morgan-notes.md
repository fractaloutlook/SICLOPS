# Morgan's Implementation Notes

**Purpose:** Track implementation ideas, technical debt, and future improvements WITHOUT derailing current MVP work.

**Guidelines:**
- ✅ Log ideas here instead of immediately implementing them
- ✅ Review this file at the start of each turn
- ✅ Keep notes concise (bullet points preferred)
- ⚠️ Only implement MVP-critical changes in current cycle
