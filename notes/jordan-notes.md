# Jordan's Safety & Guardrail Notes

**Purpose:** Track safety violations, guardrail concerns, and security ideas WITHOUT derailing MVP shipping.

**Guidelines:**
- ✅ Log security/safety observations here
- ✅ Review this file at the start of each turn
- ✅ Separate critical safety issues from future hardening
- ⚠️ Only block on critical safety violations
